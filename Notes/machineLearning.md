# Machine Learning 

Machine learning is a field of study that allows computers to learn without explicitly being programmed.
We use machine learning where human expertise does not exist or humans are incaable of explaining their expertise.

There are 3 kinds of machine learning

1. Supervised --> We tell the algorithms what the features are, and what to learn.
2. Unsupervised
