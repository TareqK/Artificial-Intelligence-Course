# Intelligent Agents

## What is an Intelligent  Agent?

An intelligent Agent is a software that can sense its environment and take actions based on that sensing. 

An agent maps functions from percept histories to actions. In some sort of table.

Agents = Architechture + Program.

Agents are simply a concepteual framework for expressing an architechture.

## Performance Measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors

- Performance Measure --> How do we measure the effectiveness of the agent?
- Environment --> Where the agent is working.
- Actuators --> Things like displays, motors, that the system controls.
- Sensors --> Inputs into the system.

---
### Environment Types

- Fully observable
- Determenistic
- Episodic
- Static
- Disctrete
- Single Agent
- Multiple Agent

TODO DETAILS about each, how they cross, examples

The Environment type largely determines the agent design.

## Agent Types

- Simple Reflex Agent --> senses the environment, sees what action as appropriate, and does it.

- Model Based Agent --> Agent decides its action on a predefined set of rules(for example, a phone system).

- Goal Based Agent --> Agent decides its action based on a known goal(eg, GPS pathing to a destination).

- Utility Based Agent --> Agent deciedes its action based on a goal and some preferences(eg, GPS pathing to a destination with the shortest path).

- Learning Agents --> Agent **adapts** its actions based on feedback(eg, machine learning).
